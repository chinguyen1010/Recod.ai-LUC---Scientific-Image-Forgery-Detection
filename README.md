# Recod.ai-LUC: Scientific-Image-Forgery-Detection
Develop methods that can accurately detect and segment copy-move forgeries within biomedical research images. Scientific images are central to published research, but not all of them are honest. Help protect science from fraudulent image manipulation by building models that can detect and segment copy-move forgeries in biomedical images.
